# Enhanced Instagram Authentication

## Overview

The Instagram import feature has been significantly improved to handle modern Instagram authentication challenges, including OAuth verification, 2FA, and security checkpoints.

## New Features

### 1. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Support
- Added 2FA code input field
- Handles Instagram's 2FA requirement automatically
- Clear prompts when 2FA is needed

### 2. Challenge/Checkpoint Handling
- Detects Instagram security challenges
- Provides direct links to complete verification
- Clear instructions for browser-based authentication

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- **Checkpoint Required**: When Instagram requires browser verification
- **2FA Required**: When two-factor authentication is needed
- **Rate Limited**: When too many login attempts are made
- **Suspicious Activity**: When Instagram blocks automated access
- **Profile Access Errors**: When profiles are private or don't exist

### 4. Session Management
- Improved session file handling
- Automatic session cleanup for corrupted files
- Better session persistence with "Remember me" option

### 5. Manual Session Creation
- Instructions for creating session files manually
- Alternative authentication method for challenging cases
- Command-line instructions for advanced users

## How to Use

### Basic Usage
1. Enter the Instagram profile name you want to import from
2. Enter your Instagram username
3. Enter your password (optional if you have a saved session)
4. Set max images to download
5. Click "Import"

### With 2FA
1. Follow basic usage steps
2. If prompted for 2FA, enter your 6-digit code
3. Retry the import

### Handling Challenges
1. If Instagram requires verification, a challenge link will appear
2. Click "Open Challenge" to complete verification in your browser
3. After completing the challenge, retry the import
4. Optionally, create a manual session file for future use

### Manual Session Creation
If you encounter repeated authentication issues:

1. **Method 1 - Command Line**:
   ```bash
   pip install instaloader
   instaloader --login your_username --sessionfile ./instagram_sessions/your_username.session
   ```

2. **Method 2 - Python Console**:
   ```python
   import instaloader
   L = instaloader.Instaloader()
   L.login("your_username", "your_password")  # Follow any 2FA prompts
   L.save_session_to_file("./instagram_sessions/your_username.session")
   ```

3. Place the session file in the `instagram_sessions` directory
4. Use the import feature without entering a password

## Troubleshooting

### "Checkpoint Required" Error
- This is Instagram's security measure
- Complete the verification in your browser
- Try again after verification
- Consider creating a manual session file

### Rate Limiting
- Wait a few hours before trying again
- Consider using a manual session file
- Reduce the number of import attempts

### Suspicious Activity
- Log in manually through Instagram.com first
- Complete any security challenges
- Wait before attempting automated access again

### Profile Not Found
- Check that the profile name is correct
- Ensure the profile is public
- Verify you have permission to access the profile

## Best Practices

1. **Use Session Files**: Enable "Remember me" to avoid repeated logins
2. **Respect Rate Limits**: Don't make too many requests in a short time
3. **Handle 2FA Properly**: Have your 2FA device ready when importing
4. **Browser Verification**: Keep a browser tab open for Instagram challenges
5. **Manual Sessions**: For problematic accounts, create session files manually

## Technical Details

### Error Types
- `checkpoint_required`: Instagram challenge needed
- `verification_required`: Browser verification required
- `2fa_required`: Two-factor authentication needed
- `rate_limited`: Too many requests
- `suspicious_activity`: Account flagged for automated access
- `bad_credentials`: Invalid username/password
- `profile_not_found`: Target profile doesn't exist or is private

### Session Files
- Stored in `instagram_sessions/` directory
- Named as `{username}.session`
- Contains authentication tokens for reuse
- Automatically cleaned up if corrupted

This enhanced system provides a much more robust Instagram import experience while handling the complexities of modern Instagram authentication.
